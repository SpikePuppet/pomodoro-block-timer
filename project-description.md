I want to create a simple pomodoro timer, which follows the standard pomodoro technique rule of:

```
The pomodoro technique uses a timer to break down work into 25-minute intervals called "pomodoros," separated by short breaks. After four pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken.
```

I should be able to schedule a series of these pomodoro blocks, where I can add a title to it and a description to help me focus on what I'm currently doing, and to see what's coming up.

Do this in react, and use Bun as we can see here. Try to do functionality without external libraries if possible, but you can bring them in if needed.

Make the theme a little cutesy, with a tomato which is similing. Think similar to the bun logo.

Create a plan for me to review, and when given the go ahead create a markdown file called `progress.md` for you to use for updates or context or whatever else you need.
